# Increasing Clarity and Accuracy in Social Media Usage Analysis via Pruning Decision Trees

 This repository uses a dataset from a social media survey to show how **pruning** impacts Decision Trees' **performance** and **interpretability**.  With an emphasis on streamlining models without compromising predictive ability, the research investigates anticipating restlessness based on characteristics including age, gender, usage time, distraction, and comparison.


 ## Project Synopsis

 **Goal**: To demonstrate how decision tree pruning reduces overfitting and enhances accuracy and interpretability.
 **Dataset**: A social media survey that included psychological scores (distraction, comparison, etc.) and characteristics like age, gender, and usage time.
 The task at hand is to predict, using a binary classification, if someone gets restless when they aren't using social media.
 **Key Techniques**: Decision Tree Classifier, feature importance analysis, pruning using `max_depth`, and visualizations.
