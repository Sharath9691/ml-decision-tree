# Pruning Decision Trees: Boosting Accuracy and Clarity in Social Media Usage Analysis

This repository demonstrates how **pruning** affects the **performance** and **interpretability** of Decision Trees using a social media survey dataset. The project explores predicting restlessness based on features like age, gender, usage time, distraction, and comparison, with a focus on simplifying models without sacrificing predictive power.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: To illustrate how pruning decision trees improves accuracy and interpretability by reducing overfitting.
- **Dataset**: A social media survey with 177 responses, including features such as age, gender, usage time, and psychological scales (distraction, comparison, etc.).
- **Task**: Predict whether someone feels restless without social media (binary classification).
- **Key Techniques**: Decision Tree Classifier, pruning via `max_depth`, feature importance analysis, and visualizations.
